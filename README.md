## Live Demo

## Introduction
This repository is for my first project working with Web3 technology and developing a Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Technology used

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) programming language to develop smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain 
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment for Ethereum
- [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/) blockchain API and node service
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS framework 
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Realtime Database
- [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/) API

## How it works

Users connect their [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet and send ETH to other wallets across the Ropsten Network (an Ethereum blockchain test network). Users can include a message and keyword to post a gif along with their transaction. A history of all transactions made via the smart contract appear at the bottom of the page and are updated as new transactions are made.
